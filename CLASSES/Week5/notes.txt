Events:

body.addEventListener("click", function(e){ });

e here is very important. Through this we can control a lot of window activities. 


Timers:

setTimeout(function, delayMS): schedule a task (function) to be run in future (delayMS from now). 
setInterval(function, delayMS); schedule a task (function) to be run in future every delayMS from now.. will be called repeatedly...
