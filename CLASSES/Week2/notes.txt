web Browsers are actually called "user agents"

Attributes: that gives extra functionality to the tags:

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
    how do my pahe look good?....
    Web Browser do have their styles too...

Syntax of CSS:
    Rules:
        I) A Selector - the element on which we want to apply styles
        II) Declearation - the rule/style in a key value pair that has applied

    where to put CSS?
        III) Inline Css - not recommeneded - when we define style within the elementy
        <h1 style = "color:red"> Another heading </h1>
        
        IV)Internal CSS: When we define style in the head 
        section of the document...

        V) External CSS: Define a seperate file with ".css" extenstion and link
        to any page you want

        VI) The Browser itself - its own style sheet...

Selectors:
1) Tag/type Selectors: When we use tag name to style something

2) Class Selectors: When we define a class of styles by using "." .demo{ } ...
<h1 class = "demo">This one applied </h1>

3) ID selectors: When we define style for a unique element represented by an id.
The style is defined by us ign #a1 for example... "#"

4) Contextual Selectors: Div h1{ } // only those h1 will get  This
style
