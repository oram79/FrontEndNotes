      <p>
        <span id="a1">T</span>he <strong>cat ( <em>Felis catus</em> )</strong> ,
        commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small
        domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of
        the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have
        shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around
        7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also
        ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by
        humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable
        claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a
        strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision
        and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a
        solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes
        vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and
        grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or
        too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small
        mammals. It also secretes and perceives pheromones.
      </p>

      <p>
        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in
        temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with
        litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are
        bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as
        cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying
        and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has
        resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the
        extinction of bird, mammal and reptile species.
      </p>

      <p>
        As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the
        United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million
        households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults
        have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of
        2020. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480
        million stray cats in the world.

      <h2>Etymology and naming</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be
        the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the
        6th century. <sup> <a href="#">[4]</a> </sup> The Late Latin word may be
        derived from an unidentified African language.[5] The Nubian word
        kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.[6]
