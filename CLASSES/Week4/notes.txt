From HTML to the DOM:
    DOM: Document Object Model - 
    API (Application Programming Interface?)[that allows communication between two application]
    
    DOM allows communication between HTML,CSS and JavaScript!

    DOM Tree:
    The tree that is created in the browser memory while we load a web page.

    HTML Nodes: 
    All html elements are called HTML nodes.
    
    Text Nodes: 
    All text values are called text nodes...

    Programming the DOM: Set of Objects, functions and properties allowing scrips to interact with and modify HTML. 

    Tasks that DOM does:
        1. Finding and getting references to elements in the page To get refernce to the elemtn that you want to 
        change/alter/delete or create a new one.
        
          a) document.getElementById(id)
          b) document.querySelector(selector)
          c) docuemnt.querySelectorAll(selector)
          selector: i) "tag name" 
                    ii) Id selectors
                    iii) class selectors

        2. Creating elements and Modifying the DOM with JavaScript:
            document.createElement(name): creates a new element of type specified by the name.

            document.createTextNode(text): creates a new text node(the text withing an elements vs the element itself)


        3. Inspecting and modifying a DOM element with JavaScript


        4. Events: DOM heavily replies on a concept know as "event-driven programming"
            The examples of events might: user actions(clicking a button, move the mouse over , pressing akey, changeing tab) or browser/code intitiated actions(timers,messages from background, reporst from sensors)

        the functions that run on any triggered event are called "event handlers"

        We register a DOM event in one of the two ways:
         1. element.onevent = function()={ }
         2. element.addEventListener("event", function(){... }) & element.removeEventListener('event', function(){ ....})


        Common Events:
         load - fired when a resource has finished loading...(img)
         click - when user single clicks on an element
         dblclick - when use double clicks on an element
         keypress - when a key is pressed
         mouseover - whern the user moves the mouse over the top of the elemtn.



         let body = document.body;
let cat = document.querySelector("#cat");

body.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  console.log("body clicked");
});

cat.addEventListener("click", function (evt) {
  document.querySelector("#s1").innerHTML = "You Clicked on Cat";
  document.querySelector("#c2").innerText = "My Cat";

  cat.src = "../images/cat2.jpg";
  evt.stopPropagation();
});

document.querySelector("#c2").addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  document.querySelector("#s1").innerText = "You clicked the cat text";
});
